- confidence: for low read samples, use a liberal score of 0.05-0.1. 
For higher read samples a higher score can be used, ideally around 0.51 (majority vote).

- min_hit_groups: amount of reads needed at species level for bracken to reassign reads to this level. Default = 2, 
though when not interested in rare species, raise this to 3-4.
